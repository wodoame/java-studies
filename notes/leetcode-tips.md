Some Leetcode Tips:
1. To get the last digit of an integer you can use the formula `x % 10`
2. To concatenate a digit `y` to an integer `x` , you can use the formula `x * 10 + y`. For example to turn 5 to 51, we can do 5*10 + 1. 
3. You can use an array of length 26 to store values relating to each letter of the alphabet using the formula `arr[x - 'a']`, where `x` is a letter. The value relating to 'a' occupies position 0, that relating to 'b' occupies position 1 and so on.
