2. `final` keyword;The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).;The final keyword is called a "modifier"
3. Java Class Methods
4. Java Constructors
5. Constructor Parameters
6. Java `this` keyword
7. Calling a Constructor from Another Constructor;You can also use `this()` to call another constructor in the same class; This is useful when you want to provide default values or reuse initialization code instead of repeating it;Note: The call to `this()` must be the first statement inside the constructor.
8. Java Modifiers; Two groups: **access modifiers** (control visibility)  and **non-access modifiers** (add other features); For example: The `public` keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
9. `static` keyword; A static method belongs to the class, not to any specific object. This means you can call it without creating an object of the class; Note: A static method belongs to the class itself. You can call it without creating an object, but it cannot use variables or methods that belong to an object.
10. `abstract` keyword; An abstract method belongs to an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass:
11. Java Encapsulation; The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users.
