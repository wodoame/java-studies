`InputHandler` class accepts inputs in their correct format with an error message if the format does not match
`InputValidator` class validates the inputs provided by the user

Changes to make:
Create some seed data
Validate some of the data inputted by the user
Organize the code into packages for better structure
use the processTransaction method in handling the transactions
Show better error messages

Git:
Create branches for different features

Testing:
Write unit tests for critical methods

Extras:
Add functionality to view transaction history for each account and each account details

Exceptions:
- Example methods affected are: `getName`, `getContact`, `getAccount`, etc.
- validate withdrawals (e.g., insufficient funds)
- `InvalidAccountException`: Custom exception for invalid account operations
- `InsufficientFundsException`: Custom exception for insufficient funds during withdrawal
- `InvalidAgeException`: Custom exception for invalid age input
- `InsufficientInitialDepositException`: Custom exception for invalid age input
- `InvalidContactException`: Custom exception for invalid age input
- `InvalidNameException`: Custom exception for invalid age input
- `OverdraftExceededException` 
- Add exceptions for invalid choices in the menu


Changes I've made:
1. Used `processTransaction` method in performing transactions. It replaced the direct use of `deposit` and `withdraw` methods
2. Created an `InputHandler` class to validate user inputs
3. Added input validation to the `InputHandler` class. Some inputs such as the age and name of the customer are now validated
4. Create custom exceptions such as `InvalidAccountException` to handle wrong inputs
5. Add Seed data for accounts

Random:
Show confirmation messages only when amount is valid
1. deposit(amount)
2. validateDepositAmount

Random:
1. The transaction id should start from 001 for each account. A single global counter should not be used.
2. Fix the wrong transaction details for withdrawals in checking accounts.

```TRANSACTION CONFIRMATION
________________________________
Transaction ID: TXN014
Account Number: ACC012
Type: Withdrawal
Amount: $600.00
Previous Balance: $500.00
New Balance: $-100.00
Timestamp: Sun Dec 07 19:52:04 GMT 2025
Confirm transaction? (Y/N):  
```
3. Fix the balance value for checking account in `viewTransactionsByAccount` method of `TransactionManager` class. This includes the initial transaction.
4. Add an `InputMismatchException` for handling wrong inputs
5. Test scenario 4, 6, 7
6. `transfer` method is needed
7. Create a balance formatter to handle savings and checking account balance display

`AccountManager.getAccountsSnapshot()`
intentionally returns `new ArrayList<>(accounts)` as a defensive copy.
If it exposed the internal accounts list directly, 
any caller—such as the concurrent simulation you just added—could add/remove/clear entries and 
corrupt the manager’s internal state, breaking invariants (unique account numbers, persisted order, etc.). By cloning the list, callers can iterate or even reorder locally without risking shared mutations. This pattern becomes even more important once threads are involved; each thread works on its own snapshot while the manager keeps sole authority over the canonical list.

Next:
Read on parallel streams
Change the amount for concurrent operations to fixed values for better testing in `simulateConcurrentTransactions` method
Read on `atomic` and `volatile` keywords in Java
`Do` concurrent `transfer()` transactions
