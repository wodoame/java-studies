The Agile Manifesto is a document that identifies four (4) key values and twelve (12) principles that its authors believe software developers should use to guide their work. 

The 4 values of the Agile model
1. People and interactions rather than processes and tools
2. A functional product rather than a complete and exhaustive documentation
3. Collaboration with the client takes precedence over contract negotiation
4. Respond to change rather than follow a plan

The 12 principles of the Agile model
1. Satisfy the customer with a fast and continuous delivery
2. Accepting changing requirements, even late in the project
3. Create and deliver value frequently
4. Close and daily cooperation between the sales team and the developers
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. The most effective mode of communication is face-to-face conversation
7. Functional software is the primary measure of progress
8. Maintain a sustainable work pace
9. Continuous pursuit of excellence enhances agility
10. Simplicity is essential
11. Self-organizing teams generate the most value
