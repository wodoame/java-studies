Objectives
----------
1. Recognize different `decision-making styles` and adapt their approach.
2. Understand and navigate different `cultural perceptions of time` and deadlines.

Decision-Making Styles
----------------------
1. Consensual
  - Common in Germany, Japan, Sweden, Netherlands
  - Decisions are made `collectively`, often through lengthy, 
  inclusive discussions.
2. Top-Down
  - Common in USA, Ghana, Nigeria, China, France
  - Decision are made by a leader with `limited group input`.

Bridging the Gap: Strategies for Success
----------------------------------------
When working with Consensual cultures (as a Top-Down person) (e.g Germany)
1. Be Patient: Expect longer processes and multiple meetings. Avoid pushing for quick decisions, as this can seem careless. 
2. Build Relationships: Much of the consensus process happens informally. Invest time in side conversations to build trust
3. Value Alignment:  Recognize that once a decision is made, implementation will be smooth because everyone is already aligned

When working with Top-Down cultures (as a Consensual person) 
1. Adapt to Speed: Don't be surprised if the leader decides after minimal discussion. Show respect by supporting the decision.
2. Be Decisive: Too much indecision may reduce your credibility
3. Clarify Priorities: Ask leaders what most (e.g Speed vs. Cost)

When working in a global team (mixed team):
1. Agree no a Method Early: At the start of a project, explicitly decide how decisions will be made (e.g., "The team lead will decide after a 30-minute consultation").
2. Define criteria: Will you prioritize efficiency or inclusiveness?
3. Set Deadlines: to prevent endless debate, agree on a timeline. (e.g., "We'll aim for consensus by Friday. If not, the manager will make the final call.")

Time Management 
--------------- 
1. Linear-Time: 
  - Time is a sequence of events. Tasks are done one at a time
  - Common in Germany, USA, Switzerland, UK

2. Flexible-Time
  - Time is fluid and adaptable. Relationships and context 
  are the priority.
  - Common in Ghana, Nigeria, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia

Bridging the Gap: Strategies for Success
----------------------------------------
When moving from Flexible-Time (Your Context) to Linear-Time (Client Context):
1. Punctuality is Critical: Joining a meeting with a German or US client at 3:07 PM for a 3:00 PM start is seen as unprofessional and disrespectful.

2. Communicate Delays Early: If you are going to miss a deadline, communicate it days in advance, not at the last minute.

3. Stick to Agendas: Avoid frequent rescheduling, which can appear disorganized.

When working with other Flexible-Time colleagues (e.g., Ghana):
1. Build Relationships: Strong personal ties will smooth over logistical issues.

2. Be Patient: Expect schedules to shift.

3. Allow for Social Flow: Expect meetings to include personal conversations before business begins.

When working on a Global Team (Mixed): 
1. Co-Create a Hybrid Schedule: Discuss expectations early. Agree on what must stay fixed (e.g., "Client demos") vs. what can be flexible (e.g., "Internal team check-ins").

2. Clarify Non-Negotiables: Identify which deadlines are firm and which are guidelines.

3. Use Shared Tools: Use tools like Google Calendar and Jira to provide a clear, shared structure that everyone can see.
