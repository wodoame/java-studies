Three pillars of high-impact oral communication: `active-listening`, `confident delivery`, and `engaging in storytelling`. 

Active Listening (The foundation):
You must use both `verbal` and `non-verbal` cues to show engagement
Core active listening techniques
1. Note Taking
2. Asking Probing Questions
    a. `Open-ended` questions: Encourages detailed responses; typically starts with What, Why or How
    b. `Closed-ended` questions: Requires a specific answer (often Yes or No); used for confirmation
3. Confirm and Clarify: This technique ensures mutual understanding
    Structure:
    a. Introductory Phrase
    b. Restatement
    c. Confirming question

Delivery:
Vocal elements: Projection (volume), Tone, Modulation (pitch / pace)

Storytelling and Persuasion:
The 3-act structure of a technical story
1. The setup (the status quo)
2. The conflict (the challenge)
3. The resolution (the lesson/impact)

Rhetorical devices
1. Ethos - Credibility
2. Pathos - Emotion
3. Logos - Logic
