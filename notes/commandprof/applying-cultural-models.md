Key concept: Erin Meyer's "Culture Map".

Learning objectives:
  - Apply the Erin Meyer's Cultural Map to analyze cultural differences
  - Distinguish between low and high-context communication styles
  - Adapt persuasion techniques to a multicultural audience

Low-context vs High-context communication
-----------------------------------------
Low-Context Communication
  Communication is explicit, direct, and unambiguous. What is said is meant, and little is left for interpretation.
  "Say what you mean, and mean what you say.
  Common in: United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Scandinavia.
  In other words, the message does not require a lot of context to understand due to its direct or explicit nature.

High-Context Communication
  Communication depends heavily on context, relationships, and non-verbal cues. 
  Words often imply more than they say. "What is not said often matters more than what is said."
  Common in: Japan, China, South Korea, Middle East, much of Africa, Latin America, Southern Europe (France, Spain, Italy).
  In other words, the message requires a lot of context to understand because a lot of its meaning is indirect or implied.

Bridging the Gap in Global Teams
--------------------------------
  1. Establish Shared Norms: Agree on how decisions, updates, and issues will be communicated (e.g., "We will use written summaries after all verbal calls").
  2. Adapt Your Style: Switch between low-context and high-context communication as needed
  3. Check for Misunderstanding: Regularly verify if your audience understands you.
  4. Balance Efficiency with Relationships: Find a balance between low-context (Efficiency) and high-context communication (Trust)

Task 1 solution:
Hi `client name`,
Thank you for your feedback. I have noticed the two critical issues:
  1. UI Layout: The login page is breaking on mobile devices.
  2. API Performance: The user dashboard response time is exceeding acceptable limits.
I'm investigating the mobile CSS breakpoints and the dashboard query latency immediately.
I will send you a progress update and a timeline for the fixes by 5:00pm tomorrow.

Best regards,
Bernard Wodoame

Task 2 solution:
// TODO

Persuading: Principle-First vs Applications-First
-------------------------------------------------
Principles-First (Deductive) Reasoning:
This approach involves deriving conclusions from general principles or concepts. 
It starts with a broad theory ("the why") and then moves to a specific instance ("the how").
Common in: France, Germany, Russia, Italy.

Applications-First (Inductive) Reasoning:
This approach begins with specific data, case studies, or practical examples, and then generalizes toward a conclusion. 
It starts with "the how" and may never explicitly state "the why."
Common in: U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia.

Bridging the Gap in Global Teams
--------------------------------
1. Hybrid Presentations: Start with a brief explanation of the principle behind your proposal, then immediately provide specific examples and practical applications.
2. Audience Awareness: Tailor your primary approach based on the cultural backgrounds of the key decision-makers in the room.
3. Flexibility: Be prepared to switch your approach mid-conversation if you notice a disconnect (e.g., theory-heavy explanations are losing attention).
