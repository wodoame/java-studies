Techniques for active listening:
--------------------------------
1. Pay Attention: Give the speaker your undivided attention. Minimize distractions (internal and external).
2. Show You're Listening: Use non-verbal cues like nodding, maintaining eye contact (with the camera in a virtual call), and leaning in slightly.
3. Provide Feedback (Paraphrase): Periodically summarize what the client has said to ensure you understand correctly.
Example: "So, if I understand correctly, your primary goal is to improve user engagement by 20% in the next quarter?"
4. Defer Judgment: Avoid interrupting or imposing your solutions prematurely. Hear the client out.
5. Respond Appropriately: Offer thoughtful and relevant responses that demonstrate you've understood their needs and concerns.

STAR Method:
-----------
1. Situation: "In my previous role as a data analyst, I was responsible for generating weekly reports on website traffic."
2. Task: "One week, I was tasked with creating a new report that included data from a new marketing campaign."
3. Action: "I rushed through the report generation process and made an error in my SQL query, which resulted in incorrect data. I sent out the report without thoroughly reviewing it."
4. Result: "The error was caught by my manager. I immediately learned the importance of double-checking my work and implementing a rigorous review process. Since then, I've used that process on all my reports and have avoided similar mistakes."

PAR Method:
-----------
The PAR method is a structured approach to answering questions that helps ensure clarity and completeness in your responses. It stands for:

- **P**roblem: Clearly state the issue or concern.
- **A**ction: Detail the actions you took to address the problem.
- **R**esult: Highlight the positive outcomes, quantifying the impact.

Handling Difficult or Unexpected Questions
------------------------------------------
1. Stay Calm & Use the Breather Pause: Don't panic.
2. Think Out Loud:
3. Be Honest: If you don't know, admit it. But never just say "I don't know."
