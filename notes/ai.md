The 4D's of AI Fluency

1. Delegation
  - What part of this work can AI handle?
  - What should I still do?
  - What AI tools will be best suited for this work?
  - What needs expertise, context, or judgement?

  Task:
  Pick a real task from your track and split it into
  AI should do
  I should do
  We can co-do

2. Discernment
  - Check facts
  - Validate assumptions
  - Spot hallucinations
  - Compare to best practices
  - Apply domain knowledge

3. Description
  - Give the AI a persona / role
  - Give it a task
  - Add context
  - Format of the output
  - Constraints

  You are an experience developer / designer. 
  Write a design system document that follows tailwind-like conventions.

4. Diligence - Responsibility & Ethics

  - Cite AI when necessary
  - Avoid sensitive data
  - Keep humans in the loop
  - Follow your program's guidelines
