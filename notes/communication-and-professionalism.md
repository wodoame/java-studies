Gricean maxims:
1. Maxim of Quantity -> Provide relevant information. Do not leave out important details and do not include irrelevant information.
2. Maxim of Quality -> Be truthful and accurate. 
3. Maxim of Relation -> Organize information logically. Information should be related to the topic and not stray into unrelated areas.
4. Maxim of Manner -> Be clear and concise. Avoid ambiguity.
