Learning Objectives: 
--------------------
1. Define `cybersecurity` and its importance in modern technology.
2. Explain the `CIA Triad`: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
3. Identify common `threat actors` and their motivations.
4. Understand the basic `risk management` formula.

Confidentiality
---------------
Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to confidential data. Confidentiality is achieved through various measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure communication protocols.

Integrity
---------
Integrity refers to the protection of data from unauthorized modification or tampering. It ensures that data remains accurate and reliable. Integrity is achieved through measures such as data validation, digital signatures, and access controls.

Availability
------------
Availability refers to the ability of a system to provide services to authorized users when they need them. It ensures that systems are operational and accessible to users. Availability is achieved through measures such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing.
